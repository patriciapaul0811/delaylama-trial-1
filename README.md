### Project Description
Most apps try to keep you focused, but this one does the opposite. It's a timer that, instead of helping you work, helps you get perfectly distracted.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are simply getting too much done ‚Äî where‚Äôs the thrill of procrastination?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an app that secretly doubles your wait time while you think you‚Äôre only wasting a minute. With a fun loading animation and reassuring message, you can procrastinate in style, guilt-free and blissfully unaware!
